Our program is designed using an app bar and sliding navigation view to enable easy navigation and a modern UI.
The program use multiple fragments and only a single activity to handle all login, sign up, and vehicle info.
For larger screens the "home" page shows two fragments at once. In addition the app uses a viewmodel to have livedata
updates in the vehicle detail fragment.

all of those fragments as well.

Hector Mendoza handled UI elements for vehicle information and was instrumental in completing the adapter needed the 
Recycler View as well as filling the Vehivle ui elements
