Our program is designed using an app bar and sliding navigation view to enable easy navigation and a modern UI.
The program uses multiple fragments and only a single activity to handle all login, sign up, home, settings, 
budget, and graphs. The budget page is where a user enters their salary (anually), max daily expense, and 
desired savings to be given an expected saving. From the home page, a user can enter more expenses if needed.
In settings, a user can change/update their information and log out. Graphs should display an income/expense 
visual for the user.


Clayton worked on implementing the logic with the budget page, along with user interface elements belonging
to it. He also worked on the adapter, and functionalities within the graphing.

Jocelyn handled choosing the color scheme of the app, adding half of the user interface for the budget page,
and the user interface functionality of the settings page.

Hector created the repo, worked on the navigation slider, along with drawer items and found and implemented
graphs, worked on the user interface, and worked on input validation.
